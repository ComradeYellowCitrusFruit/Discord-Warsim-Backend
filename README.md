Discord Warsim, Discount Warsim but on Discord, as a bot  
Bottom text

#### But Discord Warsim is a bot, what do you mean this is the backend?
By backend I mean this is the 'game' part of the bot, the part that handles the calculations and what not, but does not interact with Discord.  
It instead passes information to the bot part of the bot, which passes instructions to the backend.  
The backend also handles File IO and other such things.
